Had this problem after installing VS 2015:
A .NET Framework error occurred during execution of user-defined routine or aggregate "clr_GetADobjects": 
System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.DirectoryServices, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. Assembly in host store has a different signature than assembly in GAC. (Exc
eption from HRESULT: 0x80131050) See Microsoft Knowledge Base article 949080 for more information.

This fixed it:
Delete System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement assembly from AD_DW.
Run in SSMS on AD_DW database:
ALTER ASSEMBLY  
    [System.DirectoryServices] from 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\System.DirectoryServices.dll'
    with permission_set = UNSAFE --Fails if not 64 on 64 bit machines 
GO
ALTER ASSEMBLY  
    [System.DirectoryServices.Protocols] from 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.dll'
    with permission_set = UNSAFE --Fails if not 64 on 64 bit machines 
GO
